## Introduction

LionWolf haus - Restaurant tycoon - is a bash terminal-based game running a restaurant through Stock order, selling and earning, maintaining Customer Happiness. It's inspired by my childhood game "**Fastfood**" from **gamania**. Basically Similar game play style but has more detail features such as choosing the location of the venue getting different number pax of customers or upgrade the building of the venue. 

Player will have to prepare the service to look after certain number of customers changing each day by maintaining the venue budget, Wastage rate and Customer Happiness. Unexpected accidents might occur through business operations, Player can choose what to do for fixing problems and will see the result of choice. It takes users proper input to take numbers to order or selection of choice and then program will calculate how much payment due you'd have to pay or what result you'd get from your choice such as higher or lower Customer Happiness, Budget that the venue owns, Wastage rate and even a fine. If you can't manage the venue following the rules, you'll lose. 

Try to manage LionWolf Haus as many days as you can and check how much better you can predict what'll happen each days.
